# SRCL

**[Live Demo](https://sacred.computer)**

SRCL is an open-source React component and style repository that helps you build web applications, desktop applications, and static websites with terminal aesthetics. Its modular, easy-to-use components emphasize precise monospace character spacing and line heights, enabling you to quickly copy and paste implementations while maintaining a clean, efficient codebase.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:10000` in your browser of choice.

We use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) for hosting.

### Scripts (Optional)
